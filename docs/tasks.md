# Nicki — tasks

Actionable backlog. Analysis: [`investigation.md`](investigation.md), [`investigation-complexity.md`](investigation-complexity.md).

## Three goals (always)

Every change must respect **all three**. They are standing requirements, not pick-one options.

| Goal | Always means |
|------|----------------|
| **Correct functioning** | Pipeline runs end-to-end; worktrees, paths, handoffs work |
| **Harness and guardrails** | Gates, validators, smoke tests stay in place; scripts enforce what prose used to |
| **Trimming** | Prompt and docs stay lean; cut duplication when safe |

**When goals conflict**, higher tier wins:

1. Correct functioning  
2. Harness and guardrails  
3. Trimming  

Example: never trim `nicki.md` rules the harness does not enforce yet (trimming vs guardrails → keep prose). Never skip gate script to ship a smaller prompt (guardrails vs trimming → keep harness).

When goals **align**, do all three — e.g. add `check-gate.py` and trim duplicate prose in the same area once the script is proven.

---

## P1 — Workflow correct functioning

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | `create-worktree.py` | **Done.** Pull base branch, `git worktree add`, workspace `worktrees/<project>-<slug>`, copy gitignored locals from registry, `post_create`, scaffold `current-task/`, register `global-status.json`. |
| 2 | Root `worktrees/` layout | **Done** (shipped with #1). **Unified:** `worktrees/<project>-<slug>` at workspace root (single hyphen). See `create-worktree.py` and `nicki-workspace.example.yaml`. |
| 3 | `post_create` copy list | **Done** (shipped with #1). Per-project `copy` and `post_create` in workspace registry; readable by `create-worktree.py`. |
| 4 | Migrate active task | **Done.** `tetris-clone-frp` active at `worktrees/tetris-clone-frp-ghost-piece-rendering`; `global-status.json` and `status.json` use unified paths. No legacy `projects/tetris-clone-frp/worktrees/`. |
| 5 | Wire `sheep-start` to new script | Replace/extend `start-worktrees.sh` call path; keep register flow. |
| 6 | **Gherkin + spec mutual understanding** | **Done.** Archive: `docs/archive/gherkin-spec-mutual-understanding/`. See below. |
| 15 | `nicki.code-workspace` sync | **Script exists:** `scripts/generate-code-workspace.sh` regenerates `nicki.code-workspace` from `worktrees/` (Shared + one folder per git worktree). **Wire it:** run after successful `create-worktree.py` (start — add folder); run after worktree delete in `close-scope` (close — remove folder). Warn on regen failure; do not fail create/close. Skip on `--dry-run`. |

Worktree path rule: always `worktrees/<project>-<slug>` — e.g. `worktrees/nicki-create-worktree-py`, `worktrees/tetris-clone-frp-hero-section`. Never double hyphen.

Scripts: `.cursor/skills/start-task/scripts/create-worktree.py`, `register-global-status.py`, `WORKFLOW.md` (manual recovery).

### Gherkin + spec mutual understanding (#6) — done

**Goal:** Nicki and sheep do not advance past `describe` / `spec` until user and agent share the same understanding — not just formatted output.

| Step | Who | Behavior |
|------|-----|----------|
| `describe` | **sheep-describe** + **story-maker** | Ask before draft; do not invent specifics. Draft in relay until user approves. Write `story.md` only when clear and approved. |
| `describe` relay | **Nicki** | Relay blocked `open_questions` or draft `summary`; re-send sheep-describe with user context. Pause when user is silent. |
| `spec` | **sheep-spec** + **spec-maker** | Block without write when vague or forked; `open_questions` for Nicki relay. No spec file until resolved. |
| `spec` relay | **Nicki** | Present `open_questions`; re-send sheep-spec after user answers. No subtasks while spec `open_questions` non-empty. |
| Gate | **Harness** (P2) | `routing.yaml` / `check-gate.py`: block `spec` without `story_artifact`; block `subtasks` while spec `open_questions` non-empty. |

**Shipped:** `story-maker/SKILL.md`, `sheep-describe.md`, `nicki.md` (Describe + Spec relay), `sheep-spec.md`, `spec-maker/SKILL.md`, `routing.yaml` (describe → `sheep-describe`).

**Deferred to P2:** `check-gate.py` script enforcement; full E2E tetris ghost-piece Nicki run.

Projects on disk: `castlemill-landing`, `project-psychic-lemon`, `tetris-clone-frp` (one active worktree). Gitignored env is copied by script — not a layout problem.

## P2 — Harness and guardrails

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 7 | `check-gate.py` | `.cursor/skills/nicki/scripts/check-gate.py` — `status.json` + `routing.yaml` (+ validation/spec when needed). Stdout: `allowed`, `sheep`, `reason`, `user_confirm`. All steps; git tail first. |
| 8 | Nicki **calls** gate script | Add to `nicki.md`: before spawn, run script; on fail show `reason`, do not spawn. **Keep** existing gate prose until script is proven — add, don't delete yet. |
| 9 | Return YAML validator | `sheep-status` path — validate `sheep_return_contract` before write. |
| 10 | Smoke fixtures | Gate pass/fail on fixture `status.json`. Worktree script smoke if applicable. |
| 11 | Permissions | Allow `python …/check-gate.py` and `create-worktree.py` in `.cursor/permissions.json`. |

### `check-gate.py` (#7)

Script owns **whether** Nicki may spawn the next sheep — reads `routing.yaml`, `status.json`, validation/spec when a gate needs them. Nicki shows the transition card, user confirms, then runs the script; on `allowed: false`, show `reason` and stop.

That replaces routing prose duplicated in `nicki.md` and `status-read.md` (Gates + Readiness table). After the script is proven on a real task (P3 **#13**): delete those sections from `status-read.md` — **do not** replace with a diagram. File keeps field pointers and the JSON example only; routing stays in `routing.yaml` + the script.

---

## P3 — Trimming

Only after P1–P2 run clean on a real task. See deletion map in [`investigation-complexity.md`](investigation-complexity.md).

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| 12 | Trim `nicki.md` | Remove L41–51, L91–92, L105–106, L107–119, L121–135 once script is authoritative. Replace with short "run `check-gate.py`" block. |
| 13 | Trim `status-read.md` | Drop L17–30; field pointers only. |
| 14 | Shorten `NICKI.md` | Maintainer doc — duplicated transition/readiness prose. |

**Hard rule:** if trim would remove a rule the script does not enforce yet, keep the prose.

---

## Defer

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Disk `consented` history | Not needed for functioning or guardrails |
| `bin/nicki` CLI | PLAN.md sketch — later |
| Typed `AgentDefinition` TS | Parallel layer |
| Full orchestrator rewrite | Chat Nicki stays |

---

## PLAN.md — multi-project workspace (later)

| # | Task |
|---|------|
| P1 | Finalize `nicki-workspace.yaml` schema |
| P2 | Minimal CLI — `workspace init`, `project clone`, `runtime install`, `doctor` |
| P3 | Dogfood across managed projects |

May merge with **#1–2** above. Update PLAN when root `worktrees/` ships.
